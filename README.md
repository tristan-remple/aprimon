This is an app I made to replace the spreadsheet I use for tracking which Pokemon I have captured in which apriballs, and various information about them. It is currently live on my portfolio: https://aqualunae.ca/pkmn

Registration is not currently open, but is planned.

Other planned features:

keyboard navigation
custom groupings
user switch
help menu
user notes
user bio
duplicate checking
validity checking
compare collections
search
delete pokemon
move pokemon from wishlist to main collection
